====== CallExecution ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

The compiler scans the tests and creates a list of actions. Each [[Action|action]] has a previous (which it came from during execution) and next action (or two in case of a branch).

The executioner executes a chain of actions. Calls are received using a complex function with timeout, checking for duplicates (ignored) and other stuff. NILs are ignored, timouts are either specified or default. Delays in a scenario is by timeout.
