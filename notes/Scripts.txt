====== Scripts ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

The scripts directory contains:
* a resource embedder go-bin

===== go-bin =====
It reads and compresses the //walked// files with bzip 2. It then stores the files as a map, using the filename as a key. The values are the bytes in hexadecimal. The written go-file contains a small routine for reading those files. __func GetStored(fn string)(r io.Reader)__

===== Walked =====
Walked means, that the supplied files are assumed to be files or directories. Directories are treated as in the usual file walk.
