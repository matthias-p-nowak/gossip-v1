====== TestRunner ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

The testrunner takes a test, creates a Tester, that one compiles the test into a sets of actions. Each call party is represented by a test party, for which a Runner is executed in parallel. 

The compiler scans the tests and creates a list of actions. Each [[Action|action]] has a previous (which it came from during execution) and next action (or two in case of a branch).

The executioner executes a chain of actions. Calls are received using a complex function with timeout, checking for duplicates (ignored) and other stuff. NILs are ignored, timouts are either specified or default. Delays in a scenario is by timeout.
